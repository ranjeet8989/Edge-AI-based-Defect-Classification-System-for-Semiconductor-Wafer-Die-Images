# Edge-AI-based-Defect-Classification-System-for-Semiconductor-Wafer-Die-Images
An Edge AI–driven wafer defect pattern classification framework using the MixedWM38 WaferMap dataset. The project employs a lightweight CNN to learn spatial defect distributions from wafer maps, enabling low-latency, edge-ready classification of wafer-level defect patterns for scalable semiconductor inspection.
